## Description:
Our project is based off of a game called Dungeons and Dragons. There are sheets associated with the game that keep track of each person's character in the game. The sheets display each character’s traits, skills, magical abilities, level, as well as other different things. For our project, there is a login as well as a signup page for new users. The signup page requires a username, first name, last name, and password confirmation. The login page only requires the username and password. The homepage is a small sample of what the entire dungeons and dragons sheet would hold. The homepage displays the user’s name at the top after they have logged in or signed up. The top part of the homepage has a form to input the character’s name, race, class, and level. This is saved to the user. Different traits can be updated, such as dexterity, strength, and wisdom. Skills can be added to that character as well as features. There is also a section to add spells. When adding the spells, the name of the spell, level, school, class, range, components, duration, and the description are displayed. When the user is through using that card, they can log out. 

## Repo Organization:
Our repository is organized into many folder on GitHub. There is a views, css, and img folder. The node_modules folder is for the Node.js language. We used GitHub because we have worked with it in the past as well as on labs and found it to be very useful and easy to integrate into Heroku. Everyone could share, edit, and upload files easily, and commit changes were shown. In every folder, the files that were created worked together and named effectively so that they could be found easily. Every push was given a description of the purspose, and all of these description were helpful in seeing generally what change was made in the commit.

##Building, Running, and Testing Code:
Building code happened in local text editors, such as Atom and VS Code. The database was built using PostgreSQL. Running the code took place locally in the terminal as well as Heroku. The terminal proved useful when needing to detect errors in the code.
